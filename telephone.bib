abstract = {Abstract Sound symbolism is a phenomenon with broad relevance to the study of language and mind, but there has been a disconnect between its investigations in linguistics and psychology. This study tests the sound-symbolic potential of ideophones{\textemdash}words described as iconic{\textemdash}in an experimental task that improves over prior work in terms of ecological validity and experimental control. We presented 203 ideophones from five languages to ...

abstract = {Onomatopoeia are frequently identified amongst infants' earliest words (Menn {\&} Vihman, 2011), yet few authors have considered why this might be, and even fewer have explored this phenomenon empirically. Here we analyze mothers' production of onomatopoeia in infant-directed speech (IDS) to provide an input-based perspective on these forms. Twelve mothers were recorded interacting with their 8-month-olds; onomatopoeic words (e.g. quack) were compared acoustically with their corresponding conventional words (duck). Onomatopoeia were more salient than conventional words across all features measured: mean pitch, pitch range, word duration, repetition, and pause length. Furthermore, a systematic pattern was observed in the production of onomatopoeia, suggesting a conventionalized approach to mothers' production of these words in IDS.},

abstract = {In the dense equatorial forest of the Congo Basin, seeing is useful for following events close by, but only hearing reveals what is further away. As Mbendjele hunter-gatherers in northern Congo-Brazzaville move about their forest they are hypersensitive to the sounds around them. All members of the party, children included, react instantly to a crack, a low rumble, or an animal call by stopping mid-step, balancing on one leg if necessary. Silent and ...

abstract = {The theory developed here is that quotations are demonstrations that are component parts of language use. Demonstrations are unlike descriptions in two main ways. They are nonserious rather than serious actions. A person demonstrating a limp isn't actually or really limping. And they depict rather than describe their referents, though they depict only selected aspects of the referents. The demonstrator of the limp depicts some but not all of its aspects. Quotations, we argue, have all the properties of genuine demonstrations. They too are nonserious actions and selective depictions. For evidence we appeal to a wide range of phenomena in spontaneous spoken and written quotations.},
