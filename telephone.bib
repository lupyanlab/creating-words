abstract = {Onomatopoeia are frequently identified amongst infants' earliest words (Menn {\&} Vihman, 2011), yet few authors have considered why this might be, and even fewer have explored this phenomenon empirically. Here we analyze mothers' production of onomatopoeia in infant-directed speech (IDS) to provide an input-based perspective on these forms. Twelve mothers were recorded interacting with their 8-month-olds; onomatopoeic words (e.g. quack) were compared acoustically with their corresponding conventional words (duck). Onomatopoeia were more salient than conventional words across all features measured: mean pitch, pitch range, word duration, repetition, and pause length. Furthermore, a systematic pattern was observed in the production of onomatopoeia, suggesting a conventionalized approach to mothers' production of these words in IDS.},

This study tests the sound-symbolic potential of ideophones{\textemdash}words described as iconic{\textemdash}in an experimental task that improves over prior work in terms of ecological validity and experimental control. We presented 203 ideophones from five languages to ...
