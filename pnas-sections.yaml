  Although many words spoken today appear to have imitative origins, the
  process by which nonverbal imitations might give rise to wordlike forms has
  not been documented. Here we report evidence of imitations gradually becoming
  more wordlike through a process of unguided repetition across different
  individuals. In addition to becoming more stable both in terms of acoustic
  and orthographic properties, the novel words created through this process
  retain an iconic resemblence to the originating sound. These results
  demonstrate a pervasive tendency for establishing convention in human vocal
  communication.

  \subsection*{Selecting seed sounds}

  We initially selected a set of 36 sounds in 6 different categories of
  environmental sounds. Inanimate categories of sounds were selected because
  they were less likely to have lexicalized onomatopoeic forms already in
  English, and they were assumed to be less familiar and harder to imitate. We
  reduced this initial set to the final sample of 16 seeds using an odd-one-out
  norming procedure (N = 105 MTurk participants) designed to remove any sounds
  that were outliers within each category. The results of this norming
  procedure and selection criteria are provided in the Supplemental Materials.

  \subsection*{Collecting imitations}

  We collected the imitations online.
