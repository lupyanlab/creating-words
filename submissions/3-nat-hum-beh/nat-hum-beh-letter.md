## Letter

A Letter is an important research study of high quality and general interest to human behaviour researchers.  The text is approximately 5,000 words, including the introductory paragraph, but excluding references and figure legends. Letters should have no more than 4 display items (figures and/or tables). As a guideline, Letters contain approximately 30 references (excluding those cited exclusively in Methods). This format begins with a title of, at most, 90 characters (including spaces), followed by an introductory paragraph (not abstract) of approximately 200 words, summarizing the background, rationale, main results (introduced by "Here we show" or some equivalent phrase) and implications of the study. This paragraph should be fully referenced and should be considered part of the main text, so that any subsequent introductory material avoids too much redundancy with the introductory paragraph. Letters are not divided by headings, except for the Methods heading.
