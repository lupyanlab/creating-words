significancestatement: |
 Signed languages often rely on iconicity---a resemblance between form and meaning---in the coining of new words. Although it is now recognized that spoken languages also contain large inventories of iconic words, it is unclear how these words arise. Here, we demonstrate that word-like forms can emerge from the unguided repeated imitation of environmental sounds. We show that iterated vocal imitation causes initial imitations to become more stable and categorical, and function as better verbal labels. Surprisingly, even after eight generations, the acoustic imitations, even in transcribed form, preserve a resemblance to the original environmental sounds that motivated them, allowing people to guess the meaning from the form alone.
