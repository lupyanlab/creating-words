## Selecting seed sounds

We initially selected a set of 36 sounds in 6 different categories of
environmental sounds. Inanimate categories of sounds were selected because they
were less likely to have lexicalized onomatopoeic forms already in English, and
they were assumed to be less familiar and harder to imitate. We reduced this
initial set to the final sample of 16 seeds using an odd-one-out norming
procedure (N = 105 MTurk participants) designed to remove any sounds that were
outliers within each category. The results of this norming procedure and
selection criteria are provided in the Supplemental Materials.

## Collecting imitations

We collected the imitations online.

## Matching imitations to seeds

We did this online too.
