significancestatement: |
  Although many words spoken today appear to have imitative origins, the
  process by which nonverbal imitations might give rise to wordlike forms has
  not been documented. Here we report evidence of imitations gradually becoming
  more wordlike through a process of unguided repetition across different
  individuals. In addition to becoming more stable both in terms of acoustic
  and orthographic properties, the novel words created through this process
  retain an iconic resemblence to the originating sound. These results
  demonstrate a pervasive tendency for establishing convention in human vocal
  communication.
