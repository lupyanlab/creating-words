significancestatement: |
  Although many words spoken today appear to have imitative origins (e.g.,
  onomatopoeia), the process by which nonverbal imitations might give rise to
  wordlike forms has not been documented. Here we demonstrate the propensity of
  human vocal imitation to form more stable and repeatable utterances through
  unguided repetition. We also
  demonstrate potential cognitive benefits of forming more stable utterances:
  they are easier to learn and promote category inference. While becoming more
  conventional and wordlike, these invented words still retain a resemblance to
  the category of motivating sound, demonstrating how and why imitative words
  might pervade languages spoken today.
