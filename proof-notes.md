Q1. The sentence beginning on line 384:

"We predict that giving a harder task (i.e. more than four categories and 16 exemplars) would also yield differences in initial learning rates."

should be corrected to read:

"We predict that a harder task (i.e. more than four categories and 16 exemplars) would also yield differences in initial learning rates."

Q2. The sentence beginning on line 404:

"These results point to a way that repeated imitation may lead to forms that become more word-like and increase in stability."

should be corrected to read:

"These results show how repeated imitation may lead to more stable forms that are in turn easier to integrate into the language as category labels."

Q3. The page range for [15] is p. 1-12.

Q6. Please update the following section headers:

Line 93. The section header "2. Experiment 1: stabilization of imitations through repetition" should read "2. Stabilization of imitations through repetition"

Line 248. The section header "3. Experiment 2: resemblance of imitations to original seed sounds" should read "3. Resemblance of imitations to original seed sounds"

Line 347. The section header "4. Experiment 3: suitability of created words as category labels" should read "4. Suitability of created words as category labels"

Additional corrections:

Line 118. The sentence that reads:

"If vocal imitation played a role in the origin of some spoken words, then it is necessary to identify circumstances in which vocal imitation may begin can give rise to more word-like vocalizations that can eventually be integrated into a vocabulary of a language."

should be corrected to read:

"If vocal imitation played a role in the origin of some spoken words, then it is necessary to identify circumstances in which vocal imitation may give rise to more word-like vocalizations that can eventually be integrated into a vocabulary of a language."

Line 361. The sentence that reads:

"However, this does not provide a complete explanation of our results: the fact that transcriptions of imitations can be matched back to other category members (Category match questions) suggests that transcriptions still do carry some category information, so this is not a complete explanation of our results."

should be corrected to read:

"However, this does not provide a complete explanation of our results: the fact that transcriptions of imitations can be matched back to other category members (Category match questions) suggests that transcriptions still do carry some category information."

Line 331. The sentence that begins "Of the 1814 unique words..." should be corrected to read "Of the unique words..."

Line 401. The sentence that reads:

"Transcriptions of vocal imitations that have undergone greater repetition were processed more quickly, and generalized to new category members more easily to new category members."

should be corrected to read:

"Transcriptions of vocal imitations that have undergone more repetitions were processed more quickly, and easier to generalize to new category members."
